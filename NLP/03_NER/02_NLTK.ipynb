    "\n",
    "Relation extraction is another commonly used information extraction operation. Relation extraction as it sound is the process of extracting the different relationships between different entities. There are variety of the relationship that exist between the entities. We have seen relationship like inheritance/synonymous/analogous. The definition of the relation can be dependent on the Information need. For example in the case where we want to look from unstructured text data who is the writer of which book then authorship could be a relation between the author name and book name. With NLTK the idea is to use the same IE pipeline that we used till NER and extend it with a relation pattern based on the NER tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the following code, we used an inbuilt corpus of ieer, where the sentences are tagged till NER and the only thing we need to specify is the relation pattern we want and the kind of NER we want the relation to define. In the following code, a relationship between an organization and a location has been defined and we want to extract all the combinations of these patterns. This can be applied in various ways, for example, in a large corpus of unstructured text, we will be able to identify some of the organizations of our interest with their corresponding location:"
