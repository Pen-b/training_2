                                    "text":"""A suspected Chinese hacking campaign has breached four more US defense and technology companies in the last month, and hundreds more US organizations are running the type of vulnerable software that the attackers have exploited, according to research shared with CNN.The apparent espionage activity, which the National Security Agency helped investigate when it emerged in recent months, is more extensive than previously known and has seen the hackers steal passwords from targeted organizations with a goal of intercepting sensitive communications.The cybersecurity researchers in November publicly confirmed just one victimized US organization, CNN reported then, but they now say the number is five and could continue to grow.Globally, at least 13 organizations total in sectors such as defense, health care, energy and transportation are now confirmed to have been breached, cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks will warn in a report to be published Thursday.Palo Alto Networks identified about 600 cases in the US of systems running a type of vulnerable software that the hackers have exploited. That includes installations at 23 universities, 14 state or local governments and 10 health care organizations, the researchers said.It's the type of digital spying that the US government has for years tried to expose before it compromises sensitive data related to national security or trade secrets.The hacking effort shares similarities with the techniques of a group Microsoft has identified as operating in China, Palo Alto Networks said.The ultimate impact of the computer intrusions is not yet clear because investigations of the breaches are ongoing. But Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 researchers believe the hackers could be trying to gain long-term access to computer systems in order to siphon off key data from US companies."This adversary has aggressively targeted organizations in the United States and elsewhere in defense, technology and other critical sectors," Ryan Olson, vice president of Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 division, told CNN."While we're still learning more about the impact of these attacks, we urge organizations to quickly patch vulnerable systems and follow recommendations for determining whether they've been compromised," Olson said.The NSA declined to comment on the new research. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which has also sought to blunt the impact of the hacking campaign, referred questions to Palo Alto Networks.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.While Beijing routinely denies conducting hacking operations, cybersecurity has been a regular source of tension in US-China relations for years.The Biden administration in July blamed China for different hacking activity that exploited Microsoft email software and, experts say, exposed organizations across the world to follow-on hacks from cybercriminals.A senior Biden administration official at the time called it part of "a pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace" from China. Beijing denied involvement.The latest suspected Chinese cyberactivity does not appear to risk that level of collateral damage. But it still has the attention of senior US cybersecurity officials, who have worked with the researchers to warn potential victim companies.The hackers have in recent weeks shifted from exploiting one popular piece of software to another in a quest to compromise more organizations. Fixes are available for both software products, which are made by the multinational technology firm Zoho. But many of the firms' customers have yet to update their systems, and remain vulnerable.If Chinese involvement in the campaign is confirmed, it would add to multiple instances in recent years of alleged Chinese hackers seeking to burrow into the networks of US defense contractors.A 2014 Senate investigation found that Chinese government-linked hackers had breached contractors for US Transportation Command 20 times in one year. The command, which is responsible for the global movement of US troops and military equipment, had been aware of only two of those breaches."""

This includes the COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate, which is available via the ConecteSUS app. According to a message left by the Lapsus$ Group, which has claimed responsibility for the attack, some 50TB worth of data has been extracted from the MoH's systems and subsequently deleted. "Contact us if you want the data returned", the message said, alongside contact details for the authors of the attack. Just before 7 am, the images with the message left by the hackers were removed, but the websites remained unavailable. Black image with text in white and red left by hackers in relating to the Brazilian Ministry of Health hack. The image left by the hackers claiming the Ministry of Health attack. Following the attack, Brazilian health minister Marcelo Queiroga said his department holds a backup of the data allegedly copied and erased from the national health service's databases. The National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) said it is following up on the case. ANPD said the Ministry of Health was notified to provide clarifications on the case, as determined by the country's General Data Protection Regulations. It added Institutional Security Office and the Federal Police will be contacted to cooperate with the investigation and inspection of the attack. In September, the incident follows a previous attack on the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa). The attack was focused on the healthcare declaration for travelers, compulsory for individuals entering Brazil via airports. The attack took place soon after the cancellation of the World Cup qualifier match between Brazil and Argentina, whereby Anvisa interrupted the game after four Argentinian players were accused of breaking COVID-19 travel protocols. Similarly, the latest issue faced by the Ministry of Health occurs amid increasing pressure on the Brazilian government to demand COVID-19 vaccination certificates from international travelers coming to Brazil as a response to the rise of the omicron variant. This is not the first major security issue faced by Brazil's Ministry of Health over the last few months. In November 2020, the personal and health information of more than 16 million Brazilian COVID-19 patients were leaked online after a hospital employee uploaded a spreadsheet with usernames, passwords, and access keys to sensitive government systems on GitHub. Less than a week later, another major security incident emerged. The personal information of more than 243 million Brazilians, including alive and deceased, was exposed online after web developers left the password for a crucial government database inside the source code of an official MoH website for at least six months."""
