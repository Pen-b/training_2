    "In linguistics and grammar, A part of speech or part-of-speech (POS) is the category of a word that have similar grammatical properties. \n",

Popular NLP packages such as NLTK and spaCy include this functionality OOTB. To read more about POS, see this [POS summary](https://towardsdatascience.com/part-of-speech-tagging-for-beginners-3a0754b2ebba), the spaCy [documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#pos-tagging) and [SO explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40288323/what-do-spacys-part-of-speech-and-dependency-tags-mean), and this [POS tag reference list](https://sites.google.com/site/partofspeechhelp/#TOC-Welcome).\n",
